        "Description": "\"The weather has cleared up and we have had a pleasant walk once more. We have been to the Bibliothek again, that I might see the busts etc. on the upper floor. The bust of Gluck by Houdon gave me new pleasure. I never saw more reality and animation even in a portrait. The bust of Lessing too impresses one as a probable likeness. It is full of bright good sense. But one gets sceptical about all busts and portraits on comparing the cast of Schiller's skull with the head given to his bust. When the eyebrows of the bust and that of the skull are placed on a level, the departure of the artist from the true proportions is so gross that one sees it can have arisen from no mere incorrectness of perception, but only from a false principle. The same disgust at the incompetence or untruthfulness of artists is produced by the discrepant portraits and busts of Goethe; but there is one likeness of him that is really startling and thrilling from the idea it gives one of perfect resemblance. It is painted on a cup and is a tiny miniature, but the execution is so perfect that on applying a magnifying glass every minute stroke has as natural an appearance as the texture of a flower or the parts of an insect under the microscope. In a sort of cupboard with glass doors are preserved the coat in which Gustavus Adolphus was shot, Luther's gown, Goethe's court coat, and his Schlafrock, etc. There are endless trifles preserved in the various rooms-toys that pleased Carl Friedrich, the last Duke-an odding and winking figure etc. The only portraits that had any interest for me in the smaller rooms are those of the Grand Duchess Amalia and the Jagermann, Carl August's mistress. In the large Saal of the Library there is a portrait of Kant which one likes to look at in the faint hope that it may resemble him a little, but the grand objects of interest are the bust of Gluck, the portrait of Goethe on the cup, and the relics of Gustavus Adolphus, Luther and Goethe. The bust of Goethe taken when he was in Italy by Trippel is strikingly beautiful, but it is evidently so idealized on the Apollo type and so degraded by the front fuyant which the artist has chosen to give it that one has little satisfaction in looking at it.\" - George Eliot, Personal Diary (1854)",
