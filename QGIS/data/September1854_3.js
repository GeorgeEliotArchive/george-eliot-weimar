This was the day after our return from Ilmenau. We set off in a high wind which was very perturbing to G. It softened a little as we went on, but was still violent enough when we were in sight of Bercka, to blow G's hat off. He ran in pursuit of it and so entirely lost the sense of annoyance in that of the comic, that he began to run with squared legs and arms, making a perfect Töpffer sketch of himself. When we set out home a shower came on to which we were indebted for the said rainbow. We had neither of us before seen a rainbow thus springing from the ground, and we eagerly watched it till it faded away.\" - George Eliot, Recollections of Weimar (1865)",
