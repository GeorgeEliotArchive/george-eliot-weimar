'Oui, monsieur'. Vous allez \u00e0 Weimar, monsieur. 'Oui monsieur. J'y ai demeure depuis six semaines'. 'Est-ce que cela vous a plait?' etc. etc. I enjoyed this dialogue immensely, and we afterward referred to our ambitious grocer who was anxious to shew his knowledge of French.\" - George Eliot, Recollections of Weimar (1865)",

                "Description": "\"One of our visits to Bercka is individualized in my memory by our having read Goethe's 'Vier Jahreszeiten', and having seen a lovely rain-bow springing from the ploughed ground. This was the day after our return from Ilmenau. We set off in a high wind which was very perturbing to G. It softened a little as we went on, but was still violent enough when we were in sight of Bercka, to blow G's hat off. He ran in pursuit of it and so entirely lost the sense of annoyance in that of the comic, that he began to run with squared legs and arms, making a perfect T\u00f6pffer sketch of himself. When we set out home a shower came on to which we were indebted for the said rainbow. We had neither of us before seen a rainbow thus springing from the ground, and we eagerly watched it till it faded away.\" - George Eliot, Recollections of Weimar (1865)",

We used not to despise the fine plums which hung in tempting abundance by the road-side; but we afterward found that we had been deceived in supposing ourselves free to pluck them, as if it were the golden age, and that we were liable to a penalty of ten groschen for our depredations.\" - George Eliot, Three Months in Weimar",
