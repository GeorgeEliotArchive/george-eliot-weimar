The town of Jena is unmitigatedly dull and ugly, but Nature around it is enough to reconcile one to being there a short time. As we sat on the side of the hill, in ascending, the town looked very pretty and we heard scarcely a sound except the music of a band at various distances\" - George Eliot, Personal Diary (1854)",

This was the day after our return from Ilmenau. We set off in a high wind which was very perturbing to G. It softened a little as we went on, but was still violent enough when we were in sight of Bercka, to blow G's hat off. He ran in pursuit of it and so entirely lost the sense of annoyance in that of the comic, that he began to run with squared legs and arms, making a perfect T\u00f6pffer sketch of himself. When we set out home a shower came on to which we were indebted for the said rainbow. We had neither of us before seen a rainbow thus springing from the ground, and we eagerly watched it till it faded away.\" - George Eliot, Recollections of Weimar (1865)",

We used not to despise the fine plums which hung in tempting abundance by the road-side; but we afterward found that we had been deceived in supposing ourselves free to pluck them, as if it were the golden age, and that we were liable to a penalty of ten groschen for our depredations.\" - George Eliot, Three Months in Weimar",
