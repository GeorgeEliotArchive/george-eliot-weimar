His statue, inaugurated in 1850, stands in what is called the Herder Platz, with its back to the church in which he preached. In the right hand, is a scroll bearing his favorite motto—'Licht, Liebe, Leben' (Light, Love, Life), and on the pedestal is the inscription 'von Deutschen aller Lände (from Germans of all lands). This statue, which is by Schaller of Munich, is very much admired; but, remembering the immortal description in the 'Dichtung und Wahrheit,' of Herder's appearance when Goethe saw him for the first time at Strasbourg, I was disappointed with the parsonic appearance of the statue, as well as of the bust in the library.” - George Eliot, Three Months in Weimar (1855)",

How little real knowledge of Goethe must the mind have that could wish to see him represented as a naked Apollo, with a Psyche at his knee! The execution is as feeble as the sentiment is false; the Apollo-Goethe is a caricature, and the Psyche is simply vulgar. The statue was executed under Bettina's encouragement, in the hope that it would be bought by the King of Prussia; but a breach having taken place between her and her royal friend, a purchaser was sought in the Grand Duke of Weimar, who, after transporting it at enormous expense from Italy, wisely shut it up where it is seen only by the curious.\" - George Eliot, Three Months in Weimar (1855)",

        "Description": "\"About 1/2 past 10 Liszt called, and after chatting pleasantly for some time invited us to go and breakfast at his house, the Altenburg. Talking of Mde. D'Agout, he told us that when her novel Nelida appeared, in which Liszt himself is pilloried as a delinquent, he asked her 'Mais pourquoi avez vous tellement maltraité ce pauvre Lehmann?' On arriving at the Altenburg we were shown into the garden, where in a saloon formed by overarching trees the dejeuner was set out. We found Hoffmann von Fallersleben, the lyric poet, Dr. Schade, a Gelehrter who has distinguished himself by a critical work on the 11,000 virgins(!), and a Herr Cornelius an agreeable looking artist. Presently came a Herr or Doctor Raff, a musician who has recently published a volume called Wagnerfrage. Soon after we were joined by Liszt and the Princess Marie, an elegant, gentle looking girl of 17, and last, by the Princess Wittgenstein with her nephew Prince Eugene and a young French (or Swiss?) artist, a pupil of Scheffer. The appearance of the Princess rather startled me at first. I had expected to see a tall distinguished looking woman, if not a beautiful one. But she is short and unbecomingly endowed with embonpoint; at the first glance the face is not pleasing, and the profile especially is harsh and barbarian, but the dark, bright hair and eyes give the idea of vivacity and strength. Her teeth, unhappily, are blackish too. She was tastefully dressed in a morning robe of some semi-transparent white material lined with orange-colour, which formed the bordering, and ornamented the sleeves, a black lace jacket, and a piquant cap set on the summit of her comb, and trimmed with violet colour. The breakfast was not sumptuous either as to the food or the appointments. When the cigars came, Hoffmann was requested to read some of his poetry, and he gave us a bacchanalian poem with great spirit. I sat between Liszt and Miss Anderson, the Princess Marie's governess, an amiable but insignificant person. L. sat next the Princess and talked with her about Goethe, whom she pronounces to have been an egotist. My great delight was to watch Liszt and observe the sweetness of his expression. Genius, benevolence and tenderness beam from his whole countenance, and his manners are in perfect harmony with it. A little rain sent us into the house, and when we were seated in an elegant little drawing room, opening into a large music-salon, we had more reading from Hoffmann, and from the French artist who with a tremulous voice pitched in a minor key, read us some rather pretty sentimentalities of his own. Then came the thing I had longed for-Liszt's playing. I sat near him so that I could see both his hands and face. For the first time in my life I beheld real inspiration-for the first time I heard the true tones of the piano. He played one of his own compositions-one of a series of religious fantaisies. There was nothing strange or excessive about his manner. His manipulation of the instrument was quiet and easy, and his face was simply grand-the lips compressed and the head thrown a little backward. When the music expressed quiet rapture or devotion a sweet smile flitted over his features; when it was triumphant the nostrils dilated. There was nothing petty or egoistic to mar the picture. Why did not Scheffer paint him thus, instead of representing him as one of the three Magi? But it just occurs to me that Scheffer's idea was a sublime one. There are the two aged men who have spent their lives in trying to unravel the destinies of the world, and who are looking for the Deliverer, for the Light from on high. Their young fellow-seeker, having the fresh inspiration of early life is the first to discern the herald star and his ecstasy reveals it to his companions. In this young magus Scheffer has given a portrait of Liszt, but even here where he might be expected to idealize unrestrainedly, he falls short of the original. It is curious that Liszt's face is the type that one sees in all Scheffer's pictures-at least in all I have seen. In a little room which terminates the suite there is a portrait of Liszt also by Scheffer-the same of which the engraving is familiar to everyone. This little room is filled with memorials of Liszt's triumphs and the worship his divine talent has won. It was arranged for him by the Princess in conjunction with the Arnims, in honour of his birthday. There is a medallion of him by Schwanthaler, a bust by an Italian artist, and cabinets full of jewels and precious things, the gifts of the great. In the music salon stand Beethoven's and Mozart's pianos. Beethoven's was a present from Broadwood and has a Latin inscription intimating that it was presented as a tribute to his illustrious genius. In a room on the ground floor is a mask of Beethoven taken after his death, a very painful thing to see. I could not recognize the features.\" - George Eliot, Personal Diary (1854)",

There is a bust of Goethe, taken during his stay in Italy, which represents him as an Apollo. It is exquisitely beautiful but I cannot believe the brow to be accurate. Lessing's head and face are small, but of a fine, delicate type. Jacobi is rather feeble looking. We walked about with Schöll till it began to rain and then sought shelter with him under a door place. He is a genial unaffected man, full of accurate knowledge on all literary and philosophical subjects, and there is no German heaviness either in his appearance or his mind.
